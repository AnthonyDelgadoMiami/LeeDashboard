    <div class="romantic-text">
        <p>My dearest Lee,</p>

        <p>From the moment I touched your thigh when I picked you up on our first date, I knew my life would never be the same. There was something in your smile that spoke to my soul, something in your laughter that made my heart beat faster.</p>

        <p>Every day with you feels like a blessing I don't deserve. You've shown me what true Love means - the kind that accepts imperfections, celebrates small moments, and grows stronger with each challenge.</p>

        <p>I remember that night we spent talking for hours after I told you I Loved you, not realizing how much time had passed. Or walking around Miami (the city) with you and offering to pick you up and take you to the car, you were so shocked I offered. These moments with you are treasures I keep close to my heart.</p>

        <p>You have this incredible way of making ordinary days feel extraordinary. Your kindness touches everyone around you, your passion inspires me to be better, and your Love has healed parts of me I didn't know were broken.</p>

        <p>I Love how your eyes light up when you talk about things you're passionate about (climbing). I love the way you snore when you are relaxed enough to fall alseep, and how you always know exactly what to say to make me feel better.</p>

        <p>In my arms, I hope you've found a home. In your heart, I've found my peace. And in your Love, I've found the greatest gift life could ever offer.</p>

        <p>No matter what challenges life brings us, I want you to know that my Love for you is constant and unwavering, hopefully by now I've shown it well. You are my today and all of my tomorrows.</p>

        <p class="highlight">This secret garden is our sanctuary - a place where only our hearts speak, where our love can grow away from the world's eyes.</p>

        <p>Forever yours,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="signature">Always and completely yours, your Tonio</div>
